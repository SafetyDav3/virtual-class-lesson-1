        Hello everyone! I'm David. I live in Green Bay. I have been dabbling in
        various types of code for the past 7 years. <br />
        Starting with Arduino and their version of C++ and the RaspberryPi
        introduced me to Linux and the awesomeness <br />
        that is Python. With Python I've built various projects from a
        TwitterBot using APIs to a Brute Force program for <br />
        hacking open ports on Shodan.io, and it even worked a few times! I fill
        most of my free time with work and I do get <br />
        down on some Battlefield4 2-3 times a week. I joined the bootcamp to
        fast track the learning process and to truly <br />
        understand bringing a application to market. I'm much more interested in
        gaining the knowledge then I am seeking <br />
        employment. I'm a busy person but my time is super flexible as I am self
        employed. Looking forward to working <br />
        with others collaboratively as up to this point I have been mostly alone
        on my coding journey.
